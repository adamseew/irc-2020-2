% [Ad: I am missing an introduction of the use-case; what we are doing and why {detecting humans on ground while flying close to a tractor using marker tracking and landing when battery level is critical} {+motivation e.g., precision agriculture}]
% [Ad: (**)]

% [Ad: I feel like this need either a citation or can be phrased differently; avoid the should]
% [Ad: and got lost let's rephrase this paragraph {suggested, see (*)}]
Concerning the autonomous landing, it is not energy or time efficient for the UAV to fly back to its base. Instead the UAV should land as close as possible to its current location. Constructing and supporting many landing locations scattered around a wide area is considered as a non cost effective solution. 
Instead it is suggested that the UAV should land on other bigger ground vehicles that are close to its current location, to recharge and then take-off again to continue its mission. 
% [Ad: (*)] Apart from presenting an increased energy efficiency concerning the computations, our approach further elaborates on the landing of the UAV over a moving platform. It can be easily shown that it is not generally energy- or time-efficient for the UAV to fly back to its base, once the battery reaches a critical level. Some solutions in the literature suggested a set of landing locations scattered around a wide area. Those solutions are extended to accommodate the agricultural scenario presented in this paper, with the UAV being proposed to land on the moving vehicle that is inherently in the proximity of the drone during normal operation. 

% [Ad: I am missing context. Why are you speaking about GPS signal? Is it relevant for what we are doing?]
% [Ad: cite, there are many papers with this]
The use of

% [Ad: same]
Also, GPS signal jammers may be used to hack the drone and guide it to a non-safe location or even crash it. 
% [Ad: we would still  ideally cite this statement or support it with a set of experiments that shows it {not sure which one applies}]

scene, in order to find the location of the landing site and guide itself accordingly. Such a system is more suitable for guidance and navigation in GPS-denied locations and is more robust towards hacking attempts.

% [Ad: you mention a lot hacking attempts but I wouldn't be concerned that much in our agricultural use-case except if the farmer on the other side of the fence is little malicious and have a lot of knowledge in GPS spoofing {meaning: not sure the previous paragraph is any relevant}]

% [Ad: relative to (**) up {oh yes, it's here; just move it up and elaborate a little as then you are using it in the later paragraph}]

an agricultural case of a quadrocopter tracking and landing on a moving tractor will be studied. Furthermore, the detection and tracking of the moving ground vehicle for inspection purposes will also be studied.
